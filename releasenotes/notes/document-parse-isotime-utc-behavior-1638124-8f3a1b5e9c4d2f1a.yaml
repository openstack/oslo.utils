    `Bug #1638124 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.utils/+bug/1638124>`_:
    The ``parse_isotime()`` function's docstring now clearly documents that
    datetime strings without explicit timezone designators (Z, +HH:MM, -HH:MM)
    are treated as UTC timestamps rather than naive/local time as specified
    by ISO 8601. This behavior exists for historical reasons and backward
    compatibility. The documentation now points users to alternatives
    (``datetime.fromisoformat()`` or the ``iso8601`` library directly with
    ``default_timezone=None``) for ISO 8601 compliant parsing.
