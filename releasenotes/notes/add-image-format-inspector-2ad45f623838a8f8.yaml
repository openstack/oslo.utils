    The format_inspector module has been imported from the projects that were
    using it. They had effectively maintained in-tree forks of the original
    code from glance. This code has been imported (from Nova) into oslo.utils
    under imageutils for common use. A refactoring of how the safety check
    works was done to facilitate the ability to surface fine-grained
    information about individual checks, as needed by some projects, as well
    as a few other generalizing aspects, which are detailed in the following.

    A gpt/mbr format inspector was added, which should reduce the number of
    disk images that are detected as "raw". This furthers the goal of trying
    to avoid using "raw" for both "anything we don't recognize" and "exact
    image of a physical disk".

    The glance-centric InfoWrapper from the imported code has been replaced
    with InspectWrapper, which natively runs multiple (default: all) inspector
    classes in parallel. This is identical to what detect_file_format() did,
    but in a stream-friendly way, and detect_file_format() now uses this
    internally. Users of the glance-based code moving to the oslo
    implemenation should switch to using the InspectWrapper going forward.
