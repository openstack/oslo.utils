    Introducing a new spec DSL operator called ``<range-in>`` that allows users
    to match a numeric value against a range of numbers that are delimited with
    lower and upper limits. The new operator is a binary operator that accepts
    4 arguments.

    - The first one and the last one are brackets. ``[`` and ``]`` defines
      inclusive limits while ``(`` and ``)`` defines exclusive limits.

    - The second one is the lower limit while the third one is the upper
      limit.

    Example: "<range-in> [ 10.4 20 )" will match a value against an range
    such as the lower limit of the range is 10.4 and the upper limit is 20.
    Note that 10.4 is included while 20 is excluded.
